This is the talk about [LuaNode](https://github.com/ignacio/luanode) that was presented at the [Lua Workshop 2013](http://www.lua.org/wshop13.html).

In the _demo_ folder, there are the files needed to run the demo.
Assuming you have LuaNode available, you need to install [route66](https://github.com/ignacio/route66) by doing `luarocks install http://github.com/ignacio/route66/raw/master/rockspecs/route66-scm-1.rockspec` and then `cd demo` and `luanode sse.lua`.
