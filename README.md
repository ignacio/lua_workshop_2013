This is the talk about [LuaNode](https://github.com/ignacio/luanode) that was presented at the [Lua Workshop 2013](http://www.lua.org/wshop13.html).

In the _demo_ folder, there are the files needed to run the demo.
Assuming you have LuaNode available, you just need to `cd demo` and then `luanode sse.lua`.
